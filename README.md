# PlayStudiosAPI

This API built on .Net Core 2.1 framework with C#

Download the source code, open the solution in Visual studio( I used Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019, Version 16.6.5), Build and run

Now go to Postman and Import the collection from this link( https://www.getpostman.com/collections/f07e9757532df6d5c91f) and test

Right now Postman collection is pointing to Azure Port(http://playstudiowebapi.azurewebsites.net) where I hosted this APP under Azure APP Services. if you want to test the API locally please change the port to your localhost
